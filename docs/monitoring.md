# Community Connect Monitoring Guide

## Overview

This document describes the monitoring setup for both AWS and GCP deployments.

## AWS Monitoring

### CloudWatch Dashboards

- ECS Service Metrics
- RDS Database Metrics
- ElastiCache Redis Metrics
- CloudFront CDN Metrics

### Alerts

- CPU/Memory utilization > 80%
- Database connections > 80%
- Redis memory usage > 80%
- 5xx errors > 1%

### Logs

- ECS task logs in CloudWatch Logs
- RDS slow query logs
- CloudFront access logs in S3

## GCP Monitoring

### Cloud Monitoring Dashboards

- Cloud Run Service Metrics
- Cloud SQL Database Metrics
- Memorystore Redis Metrics
- Cloud CDN Metrics

### Alerts

- CPU/Memory utilization > 80%
- Database connections > 80%
- Redis memory usage > 80%
- 5xx errors > 1%

### Logs

- Cloud Run logs in Cloud Logging
- Cloud SQL slow query logs
- Cloud CDN logs

## Health Checks

Both AWS and GCP deployments include:

- Application health checks (/health)
- Database connection checks
- Redis connection checks
- Static/media file access checks

## Metrics

Key metrics monitored:

- Request latency
- Error rates
- Resource utilization
- Cache hit rates
- Database query performance
- Background task metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and resolutions:

1. High latency
2. Memory leaks
3. Database connection issues
4. Cache misses
5. CDN issues
